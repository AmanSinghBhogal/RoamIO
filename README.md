</div>

RoamIO is a mobile application developed as a part of the Mobile Application Development project during our 3rd year of college. It serves as a travel blog platform that allows travel enthusiasts to share their adventures and experiences through blog posts. The app is built using Java and Android Studio and integrates Firebase for Google authentication and OTP-based mobile number authentication. Additionally, static data is loaded into the app using a ready-made API from Bitbucket.
